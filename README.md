# get_address

Web Developer Test
==================

The goal is a Web app written in your language or framework of choice, with an API endpoint that returns the name of the submitted location. The source is Nominatim, a reverse geo-coder API. The app's purpose is a DB-backed cache, which avoids repeated Nominatim calls for the same location. The cached values expire in 24 hours.
